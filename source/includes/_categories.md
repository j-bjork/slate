# Categories API

The Categories API allows you to traverse the many categories on **BESTBUY.COM** and perform product searches based on category names or identifiers. The Categories API also allows you to search for specific product attributes within a specific category (example: TVs less than $100), search using multiple product attributes within a specific category (example: TVs released in the last year that are less than $100) or look at Best Buy taxonomy to better search and present Best Buy product data (example: HD TVs released in the last year that are less than $100).
